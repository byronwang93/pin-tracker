As of September 2023, I got into the competitive side of bowling, and as a result, I wanted a platform to track my stats over time. If you're like me, rest assured because this is why I created Pin Tracker! An application created to track your bowling progression, keeping note of the following (all of which can be separated based on throwing style):
- personal best
- average every year
- a chart visualizing your progress
- ability to sort your bowls based off of score or date

Additionally, I implemented a leaderboard functionality to allow you to track the progression of your friends too.

Pin Tracker is free to use, allowing you to quickly sign in through google. You can visit the site now here! https://byronwang93.github.io/pin-tracker/
